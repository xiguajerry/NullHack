# NullHack-nextgen

A utility mod migrated to the newest Minecraft versions via Fabric, Neoforge & Mixin.

Support for 1.21.5 and newer mc versions will be released with both OpenGL & Vulkan support after mc's Vulkan backend is implemented.
Before that I will continue the development of NullHack privately. You can keep contact with me by opening an issue in this repo.
